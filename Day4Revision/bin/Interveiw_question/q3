Ques 3: What are fail-fast and fail-safe collection iterations ?

Ans==>
  Collection supports two types of iterators; Fail Fast and Fail Safe. These iterators are very useful in exception handling.

   Fail Fast : The Fail Fast system is a system that shuts down immediately after an error is reported. All the operations will be aborted instantly in it.
   
   Fail Safe : The Fail Safe is a system that continues to operate even after an error or fail has occurred. These systems do not abort 
               the operations instantly; instead, they will try to hide the errors and will try to avoid failures as much as possible.
   
1) Fail Fast Iterator : It throws a ConcurrentModificationException in modifying the object during the iteration process.
   Fail safe Iterator : It does not throw Exception.
   
2) Fail Fast Iterator :	No clone object is created during the iteration process.
   Fail safe Iterator : A copy or clone object is created during the iteration process.
   
3) Fail Fast Iterator : It requires low memory during the process.
   Fail safe Iterator : It requires more memory during the process.
  
4) Fail Fast Iterator : It does not allow modification during iteration.    
   Fail safe Iterator : It allows modification during the iteration process.
   
5) Fail Fast Iterator : Performance is fast.	
   Fail safe Iterator : It is slightly slower than Fail Fast.   
   
6) Fail Fast Iterator : Examples-->	HashMap, ArrayList, Vector, HashSet, etc	                             
   Fail safe Iterator : CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap, etc.
